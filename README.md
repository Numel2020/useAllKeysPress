# useAllKeysPress

There are plenty of great solutions already available that make key input detection easy to implement in React. 'useAllKeysPress' hook combines both single and multiple key inputs in one simple React hook.

## Features

* **ES modules** and **tree-shaking** support.
* Add Size Limit to **Travis CI**, **Circle CI**, **GitHub Actions**
  or another CI system to know if a pull request adds a massive dependency.
* **Modular** to fit different use cases: big JS applications
  that use their own bundler or small npm libraries with many files.
* Can calculate **the time** it would take a browser
  to download and **execute** your JS. Time is a much more accurate
  and understandable metric compared to the size in bytes.
* Calculations include **all dependencies and polyfills**
  used in your JS.
