# useAllKeysPress

There is already a [great solution](https://usehooks.com/useKeyPress/) for making key input detection easy to implement in React. The `useAllKeysPress` elegantly combines single and multiple key inputs into one simple Hook.

## Features

* Detect keys pressed when focused on html elements such as **input**, **textarea** etc.
* Detect keys pressed in **order**.


## Installation

You can either download or copy the `useAllKeysPress.js` file into the directory of your project
then import it into your application.

```js
import useAllKeysPress from '/components/useAllKeysPress'
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
